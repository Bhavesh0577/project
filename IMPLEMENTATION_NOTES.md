## Technical Implementation Details

### GitHub API Integration

The GitHub API integration fetches:
- User profile information
- Repository data
- Star counts
- Languages used

This data is used to calculate compatibility scores and provide insights for team formation.

### Intelligent Matching Algorithms

The matching algorithms consider multiple factors:
- Technical skill compatibility (40%)
- Experience level compatibility (25%)
- Timezone compatibility (20%)
- Project interest alignment (15%)

### Mentorship Pairing Logic

The mentorship pairing logic:
- Identifies skills where mentors are Expert/Advanced and mentees are Beginner/Intermediate
- Calculates optimal meeting times based on availability patterns
- Generates focus areas based on mentor expertise
- Sorts matches by compatibility score

### AI Pitch Generation

The pitch generation system:
- Uses Perplexity API with specialized prompts
- Structures content into slide decks, scripts, and storyboards
- Formats responses as structured JSON for easy rendering
- Provides downloadable/copyable content for presentations

### ElevenLabs Integration

The ElevenLabs integration:
- Converts pitch scripts to professional audio narration
- Supports different voice options for personalization
- Returns audio data that can be played in the browser
- Can be expanded to generate full video presentations

### RevenueCat Integration

The RevenueCat integration:
- Generates code for both subscription and donation models
- Provides setup instructions for product configuration
- Includes implementation guidance for developers
- Supports multiple pricing tiers and options

## Future Enhancements

### LinkedIn Integration

- Add LinkedIn API integration to fetch professional experience and skills
- Enhance profile completeness with work history and education

### ElevenLabs Integration

- Implement text-to-speech for team introductions
- Enable voice narration for project updates

### Lingo.dev Integration

- Add multilingual support for global collaboration
- Implement real-time translation for chat messages

### Algorand/IPFS Integration

- Store team formation data on-chain for transparency
- Implement decentralized storage for project deliverables
